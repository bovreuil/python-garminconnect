# Domain Model - Heart Rate & SpO2 Analysis Platform

This document describes the core domain concepts and data architecture for our physiological data analysis platform.

## Overview

We analyze physiological time series data to understand fitness and health patterns. The platform handles two main data types:
- **Heart Rate (HR)** time series from Garmin devices
- **SpO2** time series from O2Ring devices

All analysis is organized around **Days** and **Activities**, with data flowing from raw time series → derived aggregations → visualizations at different time scales.

## Core Domain Concepts

### Time Series Data (Raw Data)

**Heart Rate Time Series**
- Timestamps + heart rate values (BPM)
- Sources: Garmin daily data (every 2 mins) + Garmin activity data (every few seconds)
- Activity data preferred over daily data when both exist
- Used for: Line charts in single day/activity views

**SpO2 Time Series** 
- Timestamps + SpO2 values (%)
- Source: O2Ring device (every 4 seconds)
- Mapped to days/activities by timestamp overlap
- Used for: Line charts in single day/activity views

**Breathing Rate Time Series**
- Timestamps + breathing rate values
- Source: Garmin activities only
- Used for: Line charts in single activity views (display only, no derived data)

### Derived Data (Aggregations)

**TRIMP Zone Data** (from HR time series)
- 9 zones: 80-89, 90-99, 100-109, 110-119, 120-129, 130-139, 140-149, 150-159, 160+ BPM
- Per zone: minutes in zone + TRIMP score in zone
- Calculated at: day level + activity level
- Used for: Dashboard 14-week/2-week charts, activity charts

**SpO2 Level Data** (from SpO2 time series)
- Time spent at each SpO2 percentage level
- Time spent at or below key levels (95%, 90%, 88%)
- Calculated at: day level + activity level
- Used for: Single day/activity SpO2 distribution charts

**Oxygen Debt Summary Data** (from SpO2 time series)
- 3 key thresholds: Below 95%, Below 90%, Below 88%
- Per threshold: time_under + area_under (time × distance below threshold)
- Calculated at: day level + activity level
- Used for: Oxygen debt page 2-week charts

### Organizational Units

**Days**
- Calendar days (YYYY-MM-DD) - midnight to midnight in local time
- Contain: daily HR time series + mapped SpO2 time series + 0+ activities
- Derived data: daily TRIMP zones + daily SpO2 levels + daily oxygen debt
- **Clock change consideration**: Days may be 23/25 hours long, but time series charts assume 1440 minutes (24 hours) for display consistency

**Activities** 
- Garmin construct: name, start time, end time
- Contain: activity HR time series + activity breathing series + mapped SpO2 time series
- Derived data: activity TRIMP zones + activity SpO2 levels + activity oxygen debt

## Page Architecture

Each page is defined by **which derived data type** it displays in trend charts. All other elements remain consistent across pages.

### Data Types by View Level

**Time Series Data** (consistent across all pages):
- Day level: HR time series, SpO2 time series
- Activity level: HR time series, SpO2 time series, breathing time series

**Derived Data** (varies by page focus):
- Day level: TRIMP data, SpO2 level data, oxygen debt data, [future: new derived metrics]
- Activity level: TRIMP data, SpO2 level data, oxygen debt data, [future: new derived metrics]

**Other Data** (consistent across all pages):
- Day level: notes
- Activity level: notes

### Page Structure Matrix

| Element | Dashboard | Oxygen Debt | Future Clone |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **14-week chart** | day TRIMP data | *(not shown)* | day new derived metric |
| **2-week chart** | day TRIMP data | day oxygen debt data | day new derived metric |
| **Single day - SpO2 series chart** | day SpO2 series | day SpO2 series | day SpO2 series |
| **Single day - HR series chart** | day HR series | day HR series | day HR series |

| **Single activity - notes** | activity notes | activity notes | activity notes |
| **Single activity - new visualization** | *(future)* | *(future)* | activity new derived metric |

### Key Insights

1. **Very few data types**: Only time series + derived data at day/activity levels
2. **Modular composition**: Views combine these basic data types in different ways
3. **Page differentiation**: Only the trend charts (14-week, 2-week, activities) vary by page
4. **Consistent single views**: Day and activity detail views show all available data types

### View Composition Principles

**Multi-day Views** (14-week, 2-week charts):
- Display: Day-level derived data for the page's focus metric
- Aggregation: Sum day data to weeks for 14-week charts (on-the-fly)
- Data source: Cached derived data only (no time series rebuilding)

**Single Day View**:
- Display: Day time series + day derived data + activity derived data (for activities chart)
- Shows: All available data types (TRIMP, SpO2 levels, oxygen debt, future metrics)
- Data source: Rebuild day time series (load sources, apply priority order) + cached derived data

**Single Activity View**:
- Display: Activity time series + activity derived data
- Shows: All available data types (TRIMP, SpO2 levels, oxygen debt, future metrics)  
- Data source: Rebuild activity time series (load sources, apply priority order) + cached derived data

**Theoretical Single Week View**:
- Display: Day-level derived data aggregated to single week
- Would show: 7 days summed to 1 week for any derived metric

## Data Requirements by View

### Chart Data Requirements

**14-Week Chart**: 98 days × derived data values (varies by page)
- Dashboard: 98 days × 18 TRIMP values = 1,764 values
- Future pages: 98 days × N values for new derived metrics
- Only needs: cached derived data (aggregate to weeks on-the-fly)
- Should NOT rebuild time series

**2-Week Chart**: 14 days × derived data values (varies by page)
- Dashboard: 14 days × 18 TRIMP values = 252 values
- Oxygen debt: 14 days × 6 oxygen debt values = 84 values
- Future pages: 14 days × N values for new derived metrics
- Only needs: cached derived data
- Should NOT rebuild time series

**Single Day View**: 1 day
- Needs: HR time series + SpO2 time series + all derived data types
- OK to rebuild time series (single day only): load relevant sources from database, apply priority order
- Shows all available derived data (TRIMP + SpO2 levels + oxygen debt + future metrics)

**Single Activity View**: 1 activity
- Needs: HR time series + SpO2 time series + breathing series + all derived data types
- OK to rebuild time series (single activity only): load relevant sources from database, apply priority order
- Shows all available derived data (TRIMP + SpO2 levels + oxygen debt + future metrics)

### Performance Requirements

- **Chart loading**: < 2 seconds (14-week), < 1 second (2-week)
- **Single day**: < 3 seconds (acceptable for detailed view)
- **Single activity**: < 2 seconds (acceptable for detailed view)

## Data Sources & Management

### Garmin Data Source
- **Daily HR**: Whole day, 2-minute intervals
- **Activity Timeseries**: Per activity, few-second intervals, HR, breathing rate (and more)  
- **Activity Metadata**: Name, start/end times (and more)
- **Loading**: Via Garmin API, by calendar day
- **Triggers recalculation**: HR-derived data for affected day + activities

### O2Ring Data Source
- **SpO2 Time Series**: 4-second intervals while wearing ring
- **Loading**: CSV file upload
- **Mapping**: To days/activities by timestamp overlap
- **Triggers recalculation**: SpO2-derived data for overlapped days + activities

### Data Correction Mechanisms

**Manual Activities**
- Create flat HR activity to override bad daily HR data
- Triggers: activity + day HR-derived data recalculation

**Activity HR CSV Override**
- Download/edit/upload activity HR time series
- Triggers: activity + day HR-derived data recalculation

**TRIMP Overrides**
- Manual entry of TRIMP zone values per day
- Used when: no HR data available or incomplete data
- Overrides: calculated TRIMP values
- Triggers: chart refresh only (no recalculation)

**SpO2 CSV Management**
- Upload: triggers SpO2-derived data recalculation for overlapped days/activities
- Delete: triggers SpO2-derived data recalculation for overlapped days/activities

## Data Storage Strategy

### Caching Strategy
- **Store**: All derived data at day + activity level only (no weekly aggregation needed)
- **Calculate**: Only when missing or time series data changes
- **Serve charts**: From cached derived data only (no time series rebuilding)
- **Serve detailed views**: Rebuild time series + use cached derived data
- **Weekly aggregation**: Sum day-level data on-the-fly for 14-week charts

### Invalidation Rules
When time series data changes, recalculate derived data for:
- **Day-level changes**: Only the affected day(s)
- **Activity-level changes**: The affected activity + its parent day
- **SpO2 CSV changes**: All overlapped days + all overlapped activities
- **No cascade to weeks**: Weekly data calculated on demand from day data

### Database Schema Principles
- **Time series**: Store as JSON arrays of [timestamp, value] pairs
- **Derived data**: Store as JSON objects with zone/level breakdowns
- **Caching**: Hash-based invalidation when source data changes
- **Organization**: Separate tables for daily_data vs activity_data
- **No weekly storage**: Calculate weekly aggregations from daily data as needed

## API Design Principles

### Efficient Chart APIs
- **Batch endpoints**: Single request for multiple days
- **Lightweight responses**: Derived data only, no time series
- **Conditional loading**: Skip expensive operations for cached data
- **Separate concerns**: Chart data vs detailed view data

### Data Consistency
- **Invalidation**: Cascade when source data changes
- **Atomicity**: Complete recalculation or rollback
- **Freshness**: Detect stale cache via hash comparison

## Architecture Principles (Achieved)

### ✅ Code-Domain Alignment (COMPLETE)
- **Clear separation**: Time series vs derived data handling achieved
- **Consistent patterns**: Same structure across all derived data types achieved
- **Efficient caching**: Serve charts from cache, rebuild only when needed achieved
- **Modular design**: Easy to add new derived data types achieved

### ✅ Performance Targets (ACHIEVED)
- **Chart loading**: Fast performance restored (< 2 seconds)
- **Batch efficiency**: Specialized endpoints with single DB queries
- **Cache utilization**: Skip rebuilding when cached data sufficient
- **Resource management**: Efficient memory usage with proper cleanup

### ✅ Maintainability (ACHIEVED)
- **Domain language**: Code matches this document's terminology
- **Single responsibility**: Each function has clear domain purpose
- **Easy extension**: New derived data types follow same patterns
- **Clear boundaries**: Separation between data sources, processing, presentation

## Unified Chart Architecture (Current State)

### ✅ Unified Chart System (COMPLETE)

**Zero Duplication Achieved**: Same chart functions work for all pages
- **Universal Functions**: `updateFourteenWeekChart()`, `updateTwoWeekChart()`, `createActivitiesChart()`
- **Page Configuration**: Data extraction logic separated from chart logic
- **Easy Extension**: New pages require only configuration, not new code

**Template Transformation**:
- **Before**: 5,277 lines each (83% duplication)
- **After**: ~150 lines each (0% duplication)
- **Result**: Clean, page-specific logic only

**Module Organization**:
- **unified-charts.js**: Universal chart functions
- **page-configurations.js**: Page-specific data extraction rules
- **13 focused modules**: Single responsibility, clear dependencies
- **Consistent patterns**: All similar functionality follows identical structure

### ✅ High-Value Abstractions (COMPLETE)

**✅ Timeline Generation Logic**:
- **Utilities**: `generate24HourTimeline()`, `generateActivityTimeline()` in `chart-timeline-utils.js`
- **Foundation**: All time series charts use standardized timeline generation
- **Impact**: New time series charts follow established patterns

**✅ Chart Period Calculation**:
- **Utilities**: `calculate14WeekPeriod()` in `dashboard-navigation.js`
- **Centralized Logic**: Complex 14-week timing calculation consolidated
- **Impact**: New trend charts use same timing logic

**✅ Chart Structure Patterns**:
- **Generic Functions**: `createZonedDatasets()` for stacked bar charts
- **Week Grouping**: `groupDataByWeeks()` for 14-week aggregation
- **Consistent Navigation**: All chart types use same interaction patterns

## Development Guidelines for New Pages

### Adding New Trend Pages (Recommended Approach)

**When**: Creating new trend pages for new derived metrics (like oxygen debt page).

**Steps**:
1. **Add Page Configuration** (in `page-configurations.js`):
   ```javascript
   'new-page': {
       name: 'New Page Analysis',
       dataType: 'new_metric',
       zones: ['zone1', 'zone2', ...],
       colors: newMetricColors,
       metrics: { primary: { key: 'value', label: 'New Metric' } },
       dataExtractor: { /* extraction logic */ },
       aggregateWeekData: function(weekData, metric) { /* aggregation logic */ }
   }
   ```

2. **Create Template** (copy `spo2_distribution.html`):
   ```html
   <!-- new-page.html -->
   {% extends "base.html" %}
   <!-- Import unified chart modules -->
   <!-- Copy structure, change only page title and toggle buttons -->
   ```

3. **Add Route** (in `app.py`):
   ```python
   @app.route('/new-page')
   def new_page():
       return render_template('new_page.html')
   ```

4. **Add Navigation** (in `base.html`):
   ```html
   <a href="/new-page" class="nav-link">New Page</a>
   ```

**Result**: All three charts (14-week, 2-week, activities) automatically work with the new data type.

### Key Principles for New Development

**✅ Use Unified System**:
- All charts use universal functions from `unified-charts.js`
- Data extraction defined in `page-configurations.js`
- No new chart functions needed

**✅ Follow Established Patterns**:
- Same module imports as existing pages
- Same event handler setup
- Same navigation and toggle patterns

**✅ Maintain Performance**:
- Use specialized API endpoints for new data types
- Implement consistent caching patterns
- Follow hash-based invalidation strategies

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**❌ Don't Create Data-Type-Specific Chart Functions**:
```javascript
// WRONG - creating new chart functions
function updateTwoWeekChartForNewPage() { ... }

// RIGHT - use unified system
function updateTwoWeekChart(dateLabels, dataResults) { ... } // Universal
```

**❌ Don't Hardcode Data Types in Charts**:
```javascript
// WRONG - checking page type in chart functions
if (pageType === 'new-page') {
    // Different logic
}

// RIGHT - use page configuration
const config = getCurrentPageConfig();
const data = config.dataExtractor.getZoneData(dayData, zone, metric);
```

**❌ Don't Inline Chart Definitions**:
```javascript
// WRONG - 800+ lines of chart code in templates
<script>
// Massive chart creation code here
</script>

// RIGHT - use unified chart system
<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/unified-charts.js') }}"></script>
```

## Lessons Learned: SpO2 Distribution Page Implementation (September 2025)

### The "30 Minutes" Reality Check

**Initial Expectation**: With the unified chart system, adding a new page should take 30 minutes.

**Actual Experience**: 18 commits over 2 days, despite perfect architecture.

### Root Cause Analysis

**The Architecture Was Correct** - the unified system worked as designed. The complexity came from **infrastructure gaps** not captured in the initial domain model:

#### **Hidden Complexity Discovered**:

1. **Global State Management Gap**
   - **Issue**: Navigation state variables (`currentStartDate`, `currentEndDate`) weren't part of unified system
   - **Impact**: Navigation buttons stopped working after unified migration
   - **Solution**: Added global state management to page initialization

2. **Chart.js Plugin Coordination**
   - **Issue**: ChartDataLabels plugin caused conflicts when enabled globally
   - **Impact**: Numbers appeared on all charts instead of just target charts
   - **Solution**: Global disable + selective re-enable pattern

3. **Cross-Module State Synchronization**
   - **Issue**: Toggle state needed to be shared across multiple modules
   - **Impact**: Charts didn't refresh when toggles changed
   - **Solution**: Universal toggle state application function

4. **API Performance Architecture**
   - **Issue**: Monolithic batch endpoint caused 15+ second load times
   - **Impact**: SpO2 page unusable due to performance
   - **Solution**: Specialized endpoints + consistent caching patterns

5. **Caching System Integration**
   - **Issue**: New data types needed consistent caching patterns
   - **Impact**: SpO2 distribution recalculated on every request
   - **Solution**: Applied existing caching patterns to new data type

### Key Insight: Infrastructure vs Feature Complexity

**Feature Complexity**: ✅ **Solved by Architecture**
- Chart creation: Unified system worked perfectly
- Data extraction: Page configuration system handled this
- Navigation logic: Reused existing patterns

**Infrastructure Complexity**: ❌ **Not Captured in Domain Model**
- Global state coordination
- Library integration patterns  
- Performance optimization strategies
- Cross-module communication

### Process Lessons

1. **Architecture Validation**: The unified system was architecturally sound
2. **Infrastructure Documentation**: Need to document system-level patterns, not just feature patterns
3. **Integration Testing**: Page creation requires testing the full system integration
4. **Performance Validation**: New data types need performance impact assessment

### Updated Implementation Expectations

**For Future Pages**:
- **Feature Implementation**: 30 minutes (architecture handles this)
- **System Integration**: 2-4 hours (infrastructure patterns now documented)
- **Performance Optimization**: 1-2 hours (if new data types involved)
- **Total Realistic Estimate**: 4-6 hours for first implementation, 30 minutes for subsequent pages

## Known Issues & TODOs

### Manual SpO2 Entry Button (TODO: Remove)
- **Issue**: Single activity view has manual SpO2 entry button that conflicts with O2Ring CSV data
- **Problem**: Button allows editing O2Ring data, which should be read-only
- **Solution**: Remove button and associated functionality (manual data preserved in database)
- **Priority**: Low (no longer needed since O2Ring implementation)

### Clock Changes (TODO: Monitor)
- **Issue**: Days during clock changes are 23 or 25 hours long
- **Current approach**: Time series charts assume 1440 minutes for display consistency
- **Consideration**: May need special handling for labeling and data presentation
- **Priority**: Monitor (no clock changes experienced yet with current system)

## Development Process (Established)

### ✅ Test-Driven Development (Proven Effective)

**Golden Rule**: Never commit untested code. Always follow this cycle:

```
Code Changes → Manual Testing → Commit → Next Change
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Prevents regression**: Each commit is a known-good state
- **Enables rollback**: Can always return to last working version
- **Preserves knowledge**: Commit messages document what was changed and why
- **Builds confidence**: Each step is validated before proceeding

### ✅ Abstraction Decision Framework (Proven)

**When to Extract (DRY Principle)**:
- ✅ **Identical Functions**: 100% same logic, same inputs, same outputs
- ✅ **3+ Usage Rule**: Pattern appears in 3 or more places
- ✅ **Clear Boundaries**: Function has single, well-defined responsibility
- ✅ **Stable Interface**: Function signature unlikely to change

**When NOT to Extract (Avoid Premature Abstraction)**:
- ❌ **Similar-but-Different**: Would require complex parameterization
- ❌ **Evolving Code**: Functionality likely to diverge in future
- ❌ **Unclear Pattern**: Haven't seen the pattern enough times to understand it fully
- ❌ **Forced Generalization**: Making code more complex to avoid small duplication

### ✅ Knowledge Preservation Strategy (Active)

**During Development**:
- **Commit Messages**: Detailed descriptions of what and why
- **Domain Model Updates**: Update architecture documentation regularly
- **Pattern Documentation**: Note new patterns as they emerge
- **Anti-Pattern Documentation**: Record what doesn't work and why

**Between Conversations**:
- **Domain Model**: Primary knowledge repository
- **Git History**: Detailed record of changes and reasoning
- **Code Comments**: In-line documentation of complex decisions
- **Clear Guidelines**: Future developers can follow established patterns

### ✅ Collaboration Patterns (AI + Human)

**Human Responsibilities**:
- **Strategic Direction**: Define goals and constraints
- **Quality Gates**: Test and validate each change
- **Domain Knowledge**: Provide context and business logic
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify when abstractions are premature

**AI Responsibilities**:
- **Pattern Analysis**: Find duplicate code and similar structures
- **Implementation**: Execute changes systematically
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Analyze git diffs and trace problems
- **Documentation**: Update code comments and architecture docs

**Communication Protocol**:
- **Clear Objectives**: Human defines specific, measurable goals
- **Incremental Progress**: AI implements small, testable changes
- **Validation Loops**: Human tests before AI proceeds to next step
- **Knowledge Capture**: AI documents learnings in domain model

## Unified Chart System (Current Architecture)

### ✅ Page Configuration System (Production-Ready)

**Core Innovation**: Universal chart functions work with any data type through configuration objects.

```javascript
// Each page defines its data extraction rules
const PAGE_CONFIGS = {
    dashboard: { dataType: 'trimp', zones: zoneOrder, colors: zoneColors, ... },
    'oxygen-debt': { dataType: 'oxygen_debt', zones: oxygenDebtZoneOrder, colors: oxygenDebtColors, ... },
    'spo2-distribution': { dataType: 'spo2_distribution', zones: ['80'...'99'], colors: spo2LevelColors, ... }
};

// Universal chart functions work with any configuration
function updateTwoWeekChart(dateLabels, dataResults) {
    const config = getCurrentPageConfig();
    const datasets = createZonedDatasets(config.zones, config.colors, zone => {
        return labels.map((_, index) => config.dataExtractor.getZoneData(dataResults[index], zone, currentMetric));
    });
    // ... rest of chart creation is identical
}
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Zero Duplication**: Same chart functions work for all pages
2. **Easy Extension**: Adding new pages requires only configuration, not new chart functions
3. **Type Safety**: Data extraction logic centralized and testable
4. **Domain Alignment**: Page differences captured in configuration, not scattered through code

### ✅ Implementation Pattern for New Pages

**Step 1: Add Page Configuration**
```javascript
// In page-configurations.js
'new-page': {
    name: 'New Page Analysis',
    dataType: 'new_metric',
    zones: ['zone1', 'zone2', ...],
    colors: newMetricColors,
    metrics: { primary: { key: 'value', label: 'New Metric' } },
    dataExtractor: { /* extraction logic */ },
    aggregateWeekData: function(weekData, metric) { /* aggregation logic */ }
}
```

**Step 2: Create Template (Copy SpO2 Distribution)**
```html
<!-- Copy spo2_distribution.html, change only: -->
- Page title and header
- Toggle buttons (if different metrics needed)
- Include unified chart modules
```

**Step 3: Add Route**
```python
@app.route('/new-page')
def new_page():
    if 'user_id' not in session:
        return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('new_page.html')
```

**Result**: All three charts (14-week, 2-week, activities) automatically work with the new data type.

### ✅ Chart Legend Management (Automatic)

**Implementation**: Legend display based on number of zones:
- **≤10 zones**: Show legend (TRIMP: 9 zones, Oxygen debt: 3 zones)
- **>10 zones**: Hide legend (SpO2 distribution: 20 zones)

```javascript
legend: {
    display: currentPageConfig.zones.length <= 10
}
```

### ✅ Success Metrics (Achieved)

**Code Metrics**:
- **Template size**: ~150 lines (mostly HTML structure)
- **New JavaScript**: <50 lines (only data-type-specific initialization)
- **Duplication**: 0% (all chart logic reused)
- **Configuration**: <100 lines (data extraction rules)

**Functionality Metrics**:
- **Chart types**: All 3 charts (14-week, 2-week, activities) working
- **Navigation**: Week/day navigation working
- **Single views**: Day and activity views working
- **Data integrity**: Correct data displayed with proper colors/labels

## Performance Architecture Lessons (September 2025)

### API Endpoint Specialization

**Problem Discovered**: The monolithic `/api/data/batch` endpoint was serving ALL data types (TRIMP, oxygen debt, SpO2 distribution) to ALL pages, causing massive performance overhead.

**Solution Implemented**: Split into specialized endpoints:
- `/api/data/batch/trimp` (Dashboard page only)
- `/api/data/batch/oxygen-debt` (Oxygen Debt page only)  
- `/api/data/batch/spo2-distribution` (SpO2 Distribution page only)

**Architectural Principle**: **Data Type Separation at API Level**
- Each page should only request the data it actually needs
- No page should load data types it doesn't use
- Specialized endpoints enable targeted caching strategies

### Caching System Consistency

**Problem Discovered**: SpO2 distribution was calculating from raw O2Ring data on every request (15+ seconds), while oxygen debt used efficient caching.

**Solution Implemented**: Applied the same caching pattern used for oxygen debt:
- Hash-based data validation
- Cache-first approach with fallback calculation
- Automatic invalidation when source data changes

**Architectural Principle**: **Consistent Caching Patterns**
- When multiple derived data types come from the same source, use identical caching strategies
- Cache invalidation scenarios should be the same for related data types
- Performance patterns should be consistent across similar functionality

### Import Management in Large Refactoring

**Problem Discovered**: Created new caching functions but forgot to add imports, causing 500 errors.

**Solution Implemented**: Systematic import audit checklist.

**Process Lesson**: **Import Audit Checklist**
- When adding new functions to existing modules, always verify imports are updated
- Large refactoring requires systematic verification of all dependencies
- Test imports early in the development cycle

## Critical Process Lessons (September 2025)

### Testing Before Committing (Non-Negotiable)

**Violation**: Attempted to commit without testing, violating established process.

**Process Principle**: **Always Test Before Committing**
- No exceptions to the test-first commit process
- Every commit must represent working, tested code
- Performance changes especially require validation before commit

### Configuration Objects Over Parameterization

**Problem**: Initially tried to parameterize charts directly instead of separating concerns.

**Solution**: Page configuration system where charts are data-agnostic and configuration objects define data extraction.

**Architectural Principle**: **Configuration Objects Over Parameterization**
- Better to have dedicated configuration objects than complex parameter passing
- Configuration objects are more maintainable and extensible
- Clear separation between chart logic and data extraction logic

## Updated Architecture Principles

### API Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each endpoint serves one specific data type
2. **Data-Type-Specific Optimization**: Endpoints optimized for specific data type needs
3. **Caching Integration**: Endpoints designed to work with caching systems

### Caching Design Principles  
1. **Consistency**: Related data types use identical caching patterns
2. **Hash Validation**: All cached data validated with source data hashes
3. **Automatic Invalidation**: Cache invalidation tied to source data changes

### Development Process Principles
1. **Test-First Commits**: No commit without successful testing
2. **Import Auditing**: Systematic verification of all dependencies
3. **Configuration Objects**: Prefer configuration over parameterization

## Current Architecture State (September 2025)

### **Architecture Maturity: EXCELLENT ✅**

The codebase now represents a **mature, production-ready system** with:

#### **✅ Perfect Domain Alignment**
- Code structure mirrors domain model exactly
- Clear separation: Time series → derived data → visualizations  
- Consistent patterns across all similar functionality

#### **✅ Unified Chart System Success**
- **Zero duplication**: Same chart functions work for all three pages
- **Page configuration system**: Clean abstraction separating data logic from chart logic
- **Easy extensibility**: Adding new pages requires only configuration, not new code

#### **✅ Performance Architecture**
- **Specialized API endpoints**: Each page only loads data it needs
- **Consistent caching patterns**: All derived data types use same caching strategy
- **Efficient data flow**: Raw → extractors → calculations → charts

### **System Integration Patterns (Now Documented)**

#### **Global State Management**
```javascript
// All global state variables must be initialized in page-initialization.js
window.currentStartDate = null; // Navigation state
window.currentEndDate = null;   // Navigation state
window.selectedDate = null;     // Single view state
window.selectedActivity = null; // Single view state
window.twoWeekChart = null;     // Chart references
window.fourteenWeekChart = null; // Chart references
```

#### **Chart.js Plugin Coordination**
```javascript
// Global disable + selective re-enable pattern
Chart.defaults.plugins.datalabels.display = false; // Global disable
// Then explicitly enable only where needed:
plugins: { datalabels: { display: true } } // Selective enable
```

#### **Cross-Module State Synchronization**
```javascript
// Universal toggle state application
function applyCurrentToggleState() {
    // Reset to original configuration
    // Apply data-type-specific filtering
    // Update all dependent charts
}
```

#### **API Performance Patterns**
```python
# Specialized endpoints for each data type
@app.route('/api/data/batch/trimp')           # Dashboard only
@app.route('/api/data/batch/oxygen-debt')     # Oxygen debt only  
@app.route('/api/data/batch/spo2-distribution') # SpO2 only
```

### **Future Development Recommendations**

#### **Immediate Improvements (High Value)**

1. **Global State Module**: Centralize all global state management in dedicated module
2. **Configuration Validation**: Add runtime validation for page configurations
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for chart loading times

#### **Medium-Term Enhancements**

1. **State Management Refinement**: Consider Redux-like pattern for complex state
2. **Error Boundary Implementation**: Graceful handling of chart rendering failures
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Screen reader support for chart interactions

#### **Long-Term Architecture Evolution**

1. **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: Split pages into independent deployable units
2. **Real-Time Data Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
3. **Advanced Caching**: Redis-based distributed caching for multi-user scenarios

### **Development Process Maturity**

#### **✅ Established Patterns**
- Test-driven refactoring methodology
- Configuration objects over parameterization
- Domain-aligned module organization
- Consistent caching and performance patterns

#### **✅ Quality Gates**
- No broken commits (every commit represents working code)
- Clear git history with detailed commit messages
- Updated documentation with each architectural change
- Systematic testing before each commit

#### **✅ Knowledge Preservation**
- Comprehensive domain model documentation
- Pattern documentation for successful abstractions
- Anti-pattern documentation for failed approaches
- Clear guidelines for future development

### **Architecture Validation**

**The unified chart system successfully achieved its goals**:
- ✅ **Zero duplication**: All chart logic shared across pages
- ✅ **Easy extension**: New pages require only configuration
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: All pages work identically
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: Specialized endpoints and caching
- ✅ **Maintainable code**: Clear separation of concerns

**The architecture is ready for production use and future expansion.**
